/**
 * This class describes ride planning.
 *
 * A ride planning helps users to plan a ride from a starting location to a destination location :
 * Given the starting and destination GPS coordinates the ride planning functionality will identify the “optimal” start and end stations
 * from/to where the bike should be taken/dropped according to the following criteria:
 * • the start, respectively the end, station, for a ride should be as close as possible to
 * the starting, respectively to the destination, location of the ride.
 * • the start station should have one bike of the desired kind (electrical or mechanical)
 * available for renting
 * • the end station should have at least one free parking slot.
